# Medical-Open-Data

Just a curated list of (trustworthy) open datasets and articles with a focus on medicine and the health sector mostly. They can be used for biomedical research/studies, public health statistics, Or in the development of healthcare solutions. There are some general datasets too but the focus is on health-related data. Everything is organized in simple plain markdown files for easy access and readability.

- [Open Data](open-data.md)
- [Data (not open)](data.md)
- [Research Utilities](research-utilities.md)
- [More resources (similar projects)](more-resources.md)

Not actively trying to maintain this but feel free to contribute if you want.
I will review requests I find as soon as possible (if any). Else, feel free to check the files
and I hope you find anything useful.
